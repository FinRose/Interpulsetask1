Coffee Sales Analysis with Excel Power Query &amp; Pivot Tables ‚Äì Data cleaning, merging, and visualization of customer orders to uncover sales trends, top customers, and country insights

üìå Project Overview
I analyzed a coffee sales dataset to uncover trends, customer behavior, and country-specific performance. Using Excel functions, PivotTables, PivotCharts, and slicers, I built an interactive dashboard with filtering options for roast type, loyalty card, year, and size.

üîç Key Insights
Arabica is the best-selling coffee type, while Robusta is steadily growing.
Customers with loyalty cards drive most of the top sales.
The highest-selling country prefers medium roast coffee, showing strong cultural influence.
Larger sizes (12oz & 16oz) dominate sales volume, showing customer preference for value packs.

‚úÖ Recommendations
Strengthen marketing campaigns in the top-performing country with a focus on medium roast.
Expand loyalty programs with more perks to retain high-value customers.
Promote larger pack sizes with bundle offers and discounts.
Keep an eye on Robusta growth as a future opportunity.
